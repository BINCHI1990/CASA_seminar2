The first dataset records 924 transaction in 2009 for in two local authorities in England. The second the data records the median house price per square meter for each region in England between 2009 and 2016. These two datasets are derived from a linked house price in England (CASA working paper213). # read in the first dataset housedata1&lt;-read.csv(&quot;data1.csv&quot;) # read in the second dataset housedata2 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data2.csv&quot;) The first house price dataset contains seven fields.They are separately refers to transaction price, transaction date.transaction year, propertys total floor area, the Census 2011 local authority district code, the Census 2011 local authority district name and region name. The second house price dataset contains four fields.They are separately refers to the Census 2011 region code, transaciton year, house price per square meter and region name.

In this seminar we focus on ggplot. 5.1.1 Basic Components of a ggplot2 Plot Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet - RStudio 5.1.2 Building a simple ggplot plot Now let us start with creating a scatter plot using ggplot().The scatter plot is created to exploring the relationship between transaction price and total floor area in two different local authorities. #### step 1 plot background ggplot(housedata1,aes(x=tfarea,y=price)) #### step 2 add a layer ggplot(housedata1,aes(x=tfarea,y=price))+ geom_point() 5.1.2.1 step 3 add the thid layer(linear regression line) ggplot(housedata1,aes(x=tfarea,y=price))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 5.1.2.2 step 4 add anoher layer ggplot(housedata1,aes(x=tfarea,y=price))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;)+ facet_wrap(~ldnm) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; #### step 4 add a linear regression line 5.1.2.3 5.1.3 5.1.3.1 5.1.3.2 5.1.3.3 5.1.4 Extensions to ggplot2 ggthemes  more diagram themes, allows you to make graphics appear as if produced by Stata, Excel, The Economist, etc. ggformula  an interface similar to lattice ggpmisc  support for time series and polynomial ts ggtern  ternary diagrams for compositional data ggforce  various geom layers, including pie charts, and other extensions ggExtra  add marginal plots etc GGally  special purpose plots, coecient plots, model diagnostics, networks, correlation matrices plotly has the function ggplotly to translate ggplot results into JavaScript diagrams suitable for websites. Since ggplot only works with data frames, #test the data set is a data frame is.data.frame(housedata1) ## [1] TRUE is.data.frame(housedata2) ## [1] TRUE 5.1.5 5.1.5.1 Here is a review of existing methods. 5.2 Sub and superscript 5.3 Saving graphs TIFF files exported directly from RStudio will only achieve a resolution of 72dpi. In RStudio, you can click on the Export button and export your plots Using ggsave is used to save a ggplot2 graph from the screen to a file ggsave(&quot;Figure_B.tiff&quot;,units=&quot;in&quot;, width=14, height=6, dpi=500, compression = &#39;lzw&#39;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 5.4 Sum up "],["challenge.html", "6 Challenge", " 6 Challenge "],["answer.html", "7 Answer", " 7 Answer We have finished a nice book.
