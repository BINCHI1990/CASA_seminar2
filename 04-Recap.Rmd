# Recap 
  
## Basic requirment of a graph 
<br>
Graphs request to be **clear, precise and efficient**,below listed some requirement of graphs
* Have a title or figure caption 
* Label axes
* Axis labels with units
* Have a legend
* legible font size

**Tip**: When you are ready to begin creating your figures,it worthwhile to understand the manuscript requirement first.so let use have a look at the CASA0005 assessment mark scheme.
