Meanwhile,different journals or publishers have different requirements for figures.

-  [SAGE Publishing manuscript Submission Guidelines](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/manuscript-submission-guidelines#Artwork)

-  [Nature submission guidelines](https://www.nature.com/srep/author-instructions/submission-guidelines)
 
-  [Wiley manuscript preparation guidelines](https://authorservices.wiley.com/asset/photos/electronic_artwork_guidelines.pdf)
 

Graphics in academic research are generally expected to be clear, concise and easy to read. Now letâ€™s have a look at some examples in the GIS course assignment of last year.
